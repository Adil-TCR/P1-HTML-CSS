        <h1>HTML FUNDAMENTALS</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <h3>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page.<br>
            It acts as a 'blueprint' to display data on a user's screen. This is the basic building block of<br>
            the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</h3>
            <br>

            <h2>What are HTML-Elements?</h2>
            <h3>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be<br>
                displayed.</h3>
                <br>

                <h2>What is a tag?</h2>
                <h3>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will<br>
                    be displayed per the instructions of the element.</h3>
                    <br>

                    <h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2>
                    <h3>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended<br>
                        the data to appear on the screen.</h3>
                        <br>
                    
                    <h2>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h2>
                    <h3>The elements we learned about were html, head, body, 'p', span, div, and h1-h6</h3>
                    <br>

                    <h2>More Elements</h2>
                    <h2>A-tag</h2>
                    <h3>The 'a' (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other<br>
                        areas within our own web page). You will always see the 'a' element used with<br>
                        the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.</h3>
                        <img src="Capture.PNG" alt="a tag image">
                        <br>
                        <h2>Img-tag</h2>
                        <h3>This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an 'src' attribute which<br>
                            points to the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in<br>
                            they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:</h3>
